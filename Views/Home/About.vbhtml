<p>
    My name is Jordon Kiger and I am a Senior at Ohio University. I am double majoring in MIS and Marketing and currently on track to
    gradute with the proper amount of hours to take the real estate state test. I am still looking for a full time job after graduation
    and I would love to move out of Ohio because I have been here too long.
